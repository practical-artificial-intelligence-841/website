## Organization of the Notes 
- The notes document starts with a **title**, **your name**, and **date** when notes were created. 

    For example:	 

    **Week 1 Reading Notes** 

    **Mihaela Sabin** 

    **Sep 4, 2023** 

- Have sections, **one for EACH assigned reading** 
    - Use the **full description of the reading as the heading** of the section in your reading notes. 
- Have subsections corresponding to main ideas in each assigned reading. 

- If you choose to include **figures**, you MUST provide a **caption**: title and source of the figure. 

## Similarity check 

- Figures taken from other sources MUST have captions. Captions MUST include the reference.  

- Failing to give attribution to the source from where you copy any material is **plagiarism** and an instance of academic misconduct.  

- At UNH all students, faculty, and staff are expected to share and uphold the value of **academic integrity**. See syllabus for this course policy on **academic integrity**. 

- UNH uses Turnitin software to check how similar your submission is with other submission or with content that can be obtained from the internet or with AI generative tools. 

- You’ll receive the similarity check report from Canvas immediately after you submit your reading notes.  

- Review the similarity check report and make changes in your notes if you omitted to quote or reference properly content from other source(s).  

## Attribution and referencing 

**Attribution** means **referencing** the source of the material you include or integrate in your notes. 
- Proper reference means that you specify **useful information about the material you are using**. Such information might include 

    - Name of who (or what) created the material 

    - Title of the material you are referencing 

    - Year when it was written or published or made available 

    - Information about where the material was made available (e.g., internet URL, newspaper, other publication, etc.)  

- You **cannot copy text from any EXTERNAL source** (that is not yours, including AI services) **without giving attribution**:  

    - **Quote** original text and **add the reference**, or  

    - **Rephrase** original text and **add the reference**.  

## Content reflects YOUR deeper understanding of the AI scientific and engineering advances  

As we develop more understanding of AI as a disciplinary study: 

- Your descriptions should **appropriately make use of key ideas, concepts, principles, techniques, approaches, algorithms, and examples we’ve studied already**.  

- Your notes should **communicate your knowledge of AI** that you’ve acquired so far from the course and from the reading. 

- Refrain from providing opinions that don’t seem to be based on the reading OR do not relate to the assigned reading.  

- If you want to include your own opinions, make that intention clear. You may say “In my view, …" or something similar.  

- Reading notes are not an essay with long paragraphs you are asked to create based on the assigned reading. They are not your opinion about the article.  

- By writing the reading notes you 

    - Simply document your reading 

    - Consolidate your understanding of the reading and/or learn new content.  

- Use bulleted (itemized) lists to write your notes and capture important ideas and main points. 

- A list item succinctly states the idea, observation, claim, or finding that you want to record. They are not whole paragraphs. 

- Typically, list items are not full sentences. They are not single words either.  

- Figures must have captions. Captions must briefly describe what the figure represents. If the figure is not yours, you must cite the source. Include the source in the references.  

- The notes content represents the essence of the reading 

    - main ideas 

    - main findings 

    - main observations 

    - main facts 

- Do not include a note item about the article author, publication, …. 

    - References section has that information 

- Must be specific about main ideas, findings, discoveries, facts 

    - Example: “The first machine could make its idea according to Rosenblatt” 

    - Feedback: What idea? What did the machine do specifically.  

- Use full name or last name of real people mentioned in the reading 

    - Do not use only their given name. Example: “Frank discovered the Perceptron” 

- Do not paraphrase the reading 

    - Do not use synonyms of adjectives or other words – this can obscure the actual meaning 

    - Do not feed text into a GPT tool because your communication skills are not strong 

        - It will PREVENT you from improving your communication skills 

- Do not construct clauses to compose phrases 

    - Example 1: “Though he didn’t find the solutions immediately, he did …” 

    - Example 2: “Even if he didn’t have enough funds, he … 

- A note item is not multiple sentences written in a simple form 

    - If multiple ideas, facts, findings, separate them out into multiple annotations	 

- Similarity score does not determine plagiarism 

    - Don't hesitate to use direct quotes due to raising similarity score 

    - Instructors review similarity score – TurnItIn is just an indicator 

- It is okay to use direct quotes when properly cited 

    - Ex. 'Rosenblatt said the Perceptron was able to think on its own' 

    - -> 'According to Rosenblatt, the Perceptron "the first machine which is capable of having an original idea." ' 

- Consider how to take notes – do you read the entire article first and go back or do you take notes as you read? 

    - Is this method working for you? Consider why the other approach may or may not be more beneficial 


##  Content is specific to the type of reference 

- **Research/technical papers, technical presentations** 

    - Capture the **foundational concepts, underlying principles, key techniques, approaches, algorithms, and examples** that are presented in the reading.  

    - Include **very brief descriptions in your own words.**  

    - Summarize main lessons learned.  

- **News and internet media articles and presentations** 

    - Present the **views of the authors or speakers in your own words.** 

    - Summarize main lessons learned. 

- Have a References section at the end of the document IF you have cited other sources in your notes.   

    - Reference items must be well-formed.  

    - If you add the source to YOUR Zotero library, you can generate the bibliographic description of the source. 

##  Writing process and submission 

- Draft the reading notes directly in a folder in OneDrive using Word (or any text editor you prefer) 

    - Synchronize the content of your OneDrive account with your laptop 

    - It makes it easier to work on your notes and keep them “safe” on the UNH OneDrive server 

- Convert the document to a PDF 

- Upload the PDF to the submission link in Canvas

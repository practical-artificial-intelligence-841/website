## Reading Conmprehension  
The purpose of the assigned readings is for you to develop a better understanding of AI as a disciplinary study, technology, or professional career. 

Reading comprehension helps you:
- Learn key ideas, concepts, principles, techniques, approaches, algorithms, and illustrative examples. 
- Communicate what you have learned. 
- Use supportive evidence and be specific in your communication.

## Writing Process
### CAE Support
To help you with the writing process of your reading notes, experts from the UNH Center for Academic Enrichmentreading are offering **weekly reading comprehension sessions**. You can also schedule **one-on-one writing tutoring appointments** to revise and get feedback on your notes. 

#### Reading Comprehension Session
- When: After class at 4 pm
- Where: Room 333
- Requirements
    - Bring the annotated hard copies of the two articles and a notebook
- During session:
    - Take notes about what you'll be discussing during the session. 

### Writing Products
Another helping element is that the development of your notes is done in two iterations;
- **RN Feedback** assignment is a first draft of your understanding of the assigned reading. 
- **RN Final** uses RN Feedback to addresses questions and issues discussed in class. 

#### RN Fedback Guidelines
- Allocate 1/2 hour of undisturbed/unplugged time to read each article. 
- Read carefully the hard copy with a pen/pencil ready to underline or make notes in the margins of the page. 
- Pay special attention to **new concepts** and **findings** you consider important.
- If there are **terms** that you are not familiar with, do a Google search.
    - Select carefully sources that seem credible and from which you can gain more understanding about the terms you are searching for. 
- Total preparation time should be 1 hour. 
    - It's recommended you do it in two separate sessions, if you can, one per article. 
    - Spacing out studying time helps with better consolidating our understanding. 
- Participate in the Reading Comprehension session with experts from the Center for Academic Enrichment. 
- Prepare a first draft  of your understanding of the assigned readings. In your draft:
    - Identify and briefly describe new concepts and technical terms. 
    - Also, list the main findings that the articles report. 
- The draft has 1-2 pages and is organized as discussed in class.  

#### RN Final

    - Review and get feedback on your first draft (RN Feedback)
    - Participate in class discussion about the first draft
    - Address the questions and issuses raised in class
    - Finalize and submit the reading notes.

## Attribution and Referencing 
**Attribution** means **referencing** the source of the material you include or integrate in your notes. 
- Proper **reference** means that you specify useful information about the material you are using. Such information includes: 
    - Name of who created the material. 
        - If the name(s) of individual author(s) is missing, you need to identify the entity that claims authorship, such as an organization, group, insitution. 
    - Title of the material you are referencing 
    - Year when it was written or published or made available 
    - Information about where the material was made available (e.g., internet URL, newspaper, other publication, etc.)  
- References are listed at the end of the notes document. 
    - Use Zotero to generate proper references.
    - Right click on the Zotero itme, select "Create Bibliography from Item ...", and then select "Chicago Manual Style 17th edition (author-date).
    
## Similarity Check  
- Failing to give attribution to the source from where you copy any material is **plagiarism** and an instance of academic integrity misconduct.  
- At UNH all students, faculty, and staff are expected to share and uphold the value of **academic integrity**. See syllabus for this course policy on **academic integrity**. 
- UNH uses **Turnitin** software to check how similar your submission is with other submission or with content that can be obtained from the internet or AI generative tools. 
- You’ll receive the similarity check report from Canvas immediately after you submit your reading notes.  
- Review the similarity check report and make changes in your notes if you omitted to quote or reference properly content from other source(s).  
- Similarity score does not determine plagiarism 
    - Instructors review similarity score – TurnItIn is just an indicator 
- You **cannot copy text from any EXTERNAL source** (that is not yours, including AI generative tools) **without giving attribution**:  
    - **Quote** original text and **add the reference**, or  
    - **Rephrase** original text and **add the reference**.  

## Organization of the Notes 
- The notes document starts with a **title**, **your name**, and **date** when notes were created. 
    For example:	 
    ```
    Week 1 Reading Notes** 
    Mihaela Sabin** 
    Jan 26, 2024
    ```
    - If the notes represent the first draft, title is **Reading Notes Draft**
- Have sections with headings to better illustrate the structure of the notes, based on the reading assginment requirements. 
    - Multiple articles should have separate headings
    - Quesitons or issues related to each article should have subheadings.  
- If you choose to include **figures** or **tables**, you MUST provide a **caption**, describing what the figure/table represents.  
- Captions of figures/tables which are taken from other sources MUST cite the reference of the source.

## Document Format and Submission 
- Write the notes in a Word document in the **Reading Notes** subfolder of **COMP 841** folder in **OneDrive**, where you'll keep all the notes.
- Upload the document to the submission link in Canvas.

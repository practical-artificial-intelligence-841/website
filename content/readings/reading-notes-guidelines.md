## Reading Conmprehension  
The purpose of the assigned readings is for you to develop a better understanding of AI as a disciplinary study, technology, or professional career. 

Reading comprehension helps you:
- Learn key ideas, concepts, principles, techniques, approaches, algorithms, and illustrative examples. 
- Communicate what you have learned. 
- Use supportive evidence and be specific in your communication.

## Attribution and Referencing 
**Attribution** means **referencing** the source of the material you include or integrate in your notes. 
- Proper reference means that you specify **useful information about the material you are using**. Such information might include: 
    - Name of who (or what) created the material 
    - Title of the material you are referencing 
    - Year when it was written or published or made available 
    - Information about where the material was made available (e.g., internet URL, newspaper, other publication, etc.)  
    
## Similarity Check  
- Failing to give attribution to the source from where you copy any material is **plagiarism** and an instance of academic integrity misconduct.  
- At UNH all students, faculty, and staff are expected to share and uphold the value of **academic integrity**. See syllabus for this course policy on **academic integrity**. 
- UNH uses **Turnitin** software to check how similar your submission is with other submission or with content that can be obtained from the internet or AI generative tools. 
- You’ll receive the similarity check report from Canvas immediately after you submit your reading notes.  
- Review the similarity check report and make changes in your notes if you omitted to quote or reference properly content from other source(s).  
- Similarity score does not determine plagiarism 
    - Instructors review similarity score – TurnItIn is just an indicator 
- You **cannot copy text from any EXTERNAL source** (that is not yours, including AI generative tools) **without giving attribution**:  
    - **Quote** original text and **add the reference**, or  
    - **Rephrase** original text and **add the reference**.  

## Organization of the Notes 
- The notes document starts with a **title**, **your name**, and **date** when notes were created. 
    For example:	 
    ```
    Week 1 Reading Notes** 
    Mihaela Sabin** 
    Jan 26, 2024
    ```
- Have sections with headings to better illustrate the structure of the notes, based on what reading assginment requirements.
- If you choose to include **figures**, you MUST provide a **caption**, describing what the figure represents.  
- Captions of figures taken from other sources MUST cite the reference of the source.

## Document Format and Submission 
- Write the notes in a Word document in the OneDrive folder where you'll keep all your notes. 
- Upload the document to the submission link in Canvas

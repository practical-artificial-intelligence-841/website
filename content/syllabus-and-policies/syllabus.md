## COURSE DESCRIPTION

### Catalog Course Description

Balancing the science of AI with its engineering applications, the
course focuses on AI foundations and principles for building intelligent
computational systems. Reasoning, planning, learning, explaining, and
acting with certainty and uncertainty are AI areas in which students
will practice how to build AI systems that solve real-world problems.
Particular attention is given to the impact of AI applications on our
society and related ethical, privacy, security, and safety implications.


### Course Goals

The purpose of the course is for you to learn what AI is and what it
means, in a practical and consequential sense and at all levels:
personal, institutional, societal, and at all of humanity levels.
Through various forms of communication and collaboration, and through
development activities we will examine AI's foundations and principles,
areas of research, and how AI applications are built and deployed to
solve problems.

### Competencies

Learning in the course will help you achieve the following professional
competencies:

-   Explore and critique AI applications and their impacts on
    individuals, communities, society, and humankind.
-   Read and analyze relevant AI literature disseminated through journal
    articles, conference proceedings papers, and popular media. Present,
    discuss, and evaluate AI approaches and technologies.
-   Examine, annotate, and evaluate the theoretical basis, design
    decisions, and implementation of open-source AI applications.
-   Participate in and bring your own contribution to the development of
    a team project that demonstrates the applicability of neural and
    symbolic AI approaches.
-   Practice with and develop personal qualities and behavioral patterns
    that are highly regarded in the workplace, such as being
    responsible, persistent, adaptable, and self-reflective.

### Modality

-   In-person, scheduled weekly class meetings
    -   Location: Room 149
    -   Day/Time: Tuesday, 1:10 - 3:00 pm
-   In-person and online engaged time and learning activities outside
    class.

### Estimated Student Workload

This syllabus reflects the federal definition of 1 credit hour, that is:

***1 credit hour*** = ***3 hours*** of ***academic work*** per week per 1
credit over a 15-week semester.

This means that the student's weekly workload, including class time, is
estimated at:
- **9 hours** per week for graduate students
- **12 hours** per week for the undergraduate students.

#### In-Class Learning

Weekly class meetings are primarily dedicated to presentations,
discussions, live coding, working in pairs or small groups, and
reflections. Therefore, teaching will use minimal lecturing. The
expectation for productive in-class learning is that you come prepared
to class meeting by fully engaging in outside class learning.

#### Outside Class Learning

Outside class time is dedicated to:

-   Guided, collaborative, and independent study activities\
    Work to complete your assignments and reflection on your learning
    experience
-   Participation in ongoing communication supported by various
    communication platforms, including Canvas and GitHub.
-   One-on-one check-ins with class instructor to evaluate your progress
-   Study group work, tutoring sessions, and consultation with other
    supports available on Manchester campus, such as CAE, Library, and
    classroom assistants.

### Simultaneous 741/841 CourseÂ Sections

Undergraduate section COMP 741 M1 is cross listed with the graduate
section COMP 841 M1. These sections are taught simultaneously to both
undergraduate and graduate students.

-   The **content** of both sections is the same in terms of **goals**
    and **competencies**, **course schedule**, and **types of learning
    activities**, whether in class and outside class.
-   The **requirements** and **expectations** of the student work,
    however, differ substantially with **assignments**, **labs**,
    **presentations**, **and team project**. These differences are
    clearly stated in the assigned work requirements and in the
    evaluation rubrics that accompany assigned work.

Graduate students are expected to demonstrate a deeper understanding of
AI foundations and principles and higher proficiency of computing skills
in building intelligent computation systems.

### Academic Integrity

Completing your own work is essential to learning.  Copying the work of others is not learning. You are expected to do your own work and not submit as yours something done by others.  

**Individual products** of your learning in this class (reading notes, design documents, code, and reflections) or **individual contributions to collaborative work** (e.g., team project) **must be entirely done by you**. You cannot submit as yours something done by others, obtained from external sources, or generated by AI genrative pretrained transformes (GPT) tools. 

**Collaborative work** has clear requirements regarding the
nature of collaboration. Grading is based on your **individual contribution to the collaborative work**. If unclear, you must consult with the course instructor on what is allowed. It is your responsibility to get such clarification. 

Whether done individually or in collaboration, **submitted coursework must ALWAYS give clear attribution to the source(s) of content** included or integrated in your work.

The instructor will reduce your grade for work that does not include proper attribution. Giving attribution has many forms, depending on how content that is NOT yours is used in your work. Thus, you may need to:

-   Cite the content that originates from other sources or has been modified and integrated in your work.
-   Reference the source(s) you have used:
    - Articles, forum or blog posts, GitHub repos, tutorials, and other accessible materials, regardless of modality (written, audio or video streaming)
    - Generated content obtained from AI tools, such as Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) and the like. 
-   Give credit to individuals who have helped you, whether peers,ntutors, lab/tech assistants, course instructor, or any other person (friend, relative, etc.)

**Do not work on behalf of someone else** and **do not provide your work products to others**.  
If you do, you commit an act of academic integrity misconduct. There is no way  
to know whether those who get your work products intend to submit them as theirs. 
Equally important, this is NOT how you help someone learn.

There are consequences if you deviate from the course and
university academic integrity policy. For academic integrity misconduct, you may receive **no credit** for the assignment in question. Persistent academic integrity misconduct will result in you failing the course. 

You will receive notice of the academic misconduct allegation from the course instructor. The course instructor will meet with you and give you the opportunity to respond. If the violation stands, the course instructor will report it to the Office of Community Standards. 

Bottom line, **do not cheat, plagiarize, or faciliate academic integrity misconduct**. It is very important that you review the University's
[Academic Integrity
policy](https://catalog.unh.edu/srrr/university-policies-regulations/academic-integrity/).


## COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OVERIEW

Student learning is assessed based on evidence produced by the following
activities. Percentages show how much each activity contributes to the
final grade.

### Participation (10% Bonus)

In-class learning encourages and supports everyone's participation.
Outside class learning can rely on participation in study group
activities, open lab work, tutoring sessions, and discussions facilitated by the use of online chat/text messaging/forum tools selected by students in consultation with the course instructor. One-on-one check-ins with the instructor during the semester provide additional assistance. 

### Assigned Reading and Reading Notes (15%)

The first exposure to AI disciplinary content happens through the
assigned reading. They are important for all the learning activities in
this course: class meeting discussions, individual presentations, lab
activities, and the team project. All students are expected to prepare notes that summarize key concepts, principles, models, and techniques, along with relevant questions and implications derived from the reading material. Reading notes are
**entirely your own individual work**. 

The reading notes:
- Are developed in two steps over two weeks and 
- Include a reading comprehension session with experts from the CAE. 

The first draft (RN Feedback) is due the following week on Friday, by 5 pm. The final notes are due the week following the draft submission deadline and no later than midnight BEFORE class. 

The reading notes are NOT accepted after the deadline.

### Lab Projects (25%)

To consolidate learning of AI concepts, principles, and techniques,
students complete lab projects that design, document, and implement AI
solutions. Lab projects are **entirely your own individual work**. They
are due the midnight BEFORE the scheduled class meeting and are NOT
accepted after the deadline.

### Team Project (60%)

The purpose of the project is to investigate and showcase the
applicability of symbolic and neural AI approaches. You'll collaborate
with a peer to propose, design, document, and showcase your
investigation. Project artifacts include a project proposal, project

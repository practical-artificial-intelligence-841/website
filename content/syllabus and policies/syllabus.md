### Credit Hour Policy
This syllabus reflects the federal definition of 1 credit hour, that is:
> **1	credit hour** = **3 clock hours of engaged time** per week per 1 credit over a 15-week semester. 

This means that this course requires **9 clock hours of student academic work each week**. 

Student academic work (or engaged time) means all your work in this class:
- Attend class meetings and participate in learning activities
- Do weekly labs, readings, and assignments
- Participate in collaborative learning experiences, such as working with peers on labs or the course team project
- Participate in scheduled study groups
- Seek and get tutoring help and other academic supports from the Library and CAE
- Consult with and get assistance from the course instructor and classroom assistants
- Attend one-on-one check-ins with class instructor to evaluate your progress.

### Academic Integrity
**Individual products** of your learning in this class (design documents, code, reflections) or **individual contributions to collaborative work** (e.g., lab, team project) **must be entirely done by you**. You cannot submit as yours something done by others or obtained from external sources.

**Collaborative work** has clear requirements regarding the nature of collaboration. Grading is based on your **individual contribution to the collaborative work**. If unclear, you  must consult with course instructor on what is allowed. It is your  responsibility to get such clarification.

Whether done individually or in collaboration, **submitted coursework must ALWAYS give clear attribution to the source(s) of content** included or integrated in your work.
   - Annotate the content that originates or has been modified and integrated in your work.
   - Reference the source(s) you used, whether articles, forum or blog posts, public GitHub repos, tutorial videos, or individual help.
   - Give credit to individuals who have helped you, whether peers, tutors, lab/tech assistants, course instructor, or any other person (friend, relative, etc.)

**Do not work on behalf of someone else** and **do not provide your work products to others**. If you do, you commit an act of academic dishonesty. There is no way to know whether those who get your work products intend to submit them as their. Equally important, this is NOT how you help someone learn. 

There are very serious repercussions if you deviate from the course and univeristy academic integrity policy. The penalty for the **first occurrence** of academic misconduct is **no credit for the graded work** in question. The **second occurrence** of academic misconduct results in **failing the course**. You will receive notice of the academic misconduct allegation from the course instructor. The course instructor will meet with you and give you the opportunity to respond. If the violation stands, the course instructor will report it to the Office of Community Standards. 

Bottom line, **do not cheat, plagiarize, or faciliate academic dishonesty**. It is very important that you review the University's [Academic Integrity policy](https://catalog.unh.edu/srrr/university-policies-regulations/academic-integrity/).

- **[Course Website](https://practical-artificial-intelligence-841.github.io/website/)** is a comprehensive source of guidelines and learning resources.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** platform is used to submit your work products (labs, homework assignments, reflections) and collaborate on the course project. Using your UNH affiliation you have free access to the GitHub Student Development Pack. 

#### Development Tools
Your personal laptop (or the laptop loaned from the department) is the development platform for all the learning activities in this class. You can use the operating system you are more comfortable with: Mac OSX,  Ubuntu or other Linux distribution, or Windows. 

The **development tools** you need to have on your machine installed at the global/system level are:
- **bash shell** available in the **terminal**  command line utility (CLI) on MacOS or Linux, or available in the **Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL)** on Windows 11. If you have Windows 10, you ned to use **git-bash**. 
- **git**
- **Python 3**
- **PyCharm** integrated development environment (IDE)and other Python tools:
   - **Python debugger**
   - **Static analysis tools** such as **flake8**, **pylint**, **pycodestyle**

#### Classroom Assistants (CAs)
The Computing Program has **classroom assistants** who are available to help learning in this course. They can also help with software configuration and other technical questions you might have. 

#### Center for Academic Enrichment (CAE) Tutoring Services
The Center for Academic Enrichment (CAE) is a free resource for all students in the College of Professional Studies. Students are entitled to 1 hour of free individual tutoring, per course, per week. Make a tutoring appointment and access the CAE services through the CAE Canvas site, call 603-641-4113 or email unhm.cae@unh.edu. CAE tutors are well-prepared to assist with questions, lab and homework assignments, and Python programming. 

### Use of Other Tools
No phone use is permitted in class, unless directed to do so. For example, you may need to use your phone to get access to the phone camera if your laptop does not have a camera and you are in a Zoom session that requires video on.

Unless otherwise specified, the use of automated writing tools, such as chatGPT and similar artificial intelligence (AI) tools, is strictly prohibited in this course, even when properly attributed. The use of automated writing tools is considered plagiarism (as defined by SRRR 9.3) and will be handled in accordance with existing policy

## Learning Strategies
> "When you do nothing you feel overwhelmed and powerless. But when you get involved you feel the sense of hope and accomplishment that comes from knowing you are working to make things better." -Maya Angelou

> "For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them." -Aristotle, ~350 BC, [Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle (mit.edu)](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.2.ii.html)

Learning in this class depends heavily on **active participation, reflective practice, open collaboration** and **support and respect** for one another. The course semester has 15 weeks with weekly 2-hour class meetings.

### Outside Class Learning
You are expected to engage in outside class learning time 7 hours every week. Outside class time is dedicated to
- Guided, collaborative, and independent study activities
- Work to complete your assignments and reflections on learning experience
- Participation in ongoing communication on the Discord server
- One-on-one check-ins with class instructor to evaluate your progress
- Study group work, tutoring sesions, and consultaion with other supports available on Manchester campus, such as CAE, Library, and classroom assistants. 

### In-Class Learning
Weekly class meetings are primarily dedicated to presentations, discussions, live coding, working in pairs or small groups, and reflections. Therefore, teaching will use minimal lecturing. The expectation for productive in-class learning is that you come prepared to the class meetings by fully engaging in outside class learning. 

## Course Requirements

### Participation
In-class learning encourages and supports everyone's participation. Outside class learning rely on study groups activities, open lab work, tutoring sessions, and  general or channel-focused discussions faciliated by the **Discord** server. One-on-one check-ins with class instructor during the semester provide additional assistance. 

### Reading Notes
Reading assignments are excellent opportunities to actively engage with the course content every week through various activities such as answering multiple-choice questions, writing short answers, and coding exercises. The reading assignments are auto-graded. Use the auto-grading feature to keep working and improve your answers and solutions. Reading assignments are **entirely your own individual work**. 

All active reading assignments are due the **midnight** before the class meeting and are NOT accepted after the deadline. 

### Collaborative Labs
You will engage in collaborative lab activities almost every week. These activities are designed to be started during the class meeting time, continue during the week, and be completed **before** the next class. Because of the collaborative nature of the labs, you have to give attribution to peers you've collaborated with as well as to other individuals who helped you. You must also properly reference external sources of content that you have included or integrated in your lab solutions.  

Labs are due the **midnight** before the class meeting and are NOT accepted after the deadline. Meeting the submission deadline is the necessary condition to receive feedback to your work. 

### Team Project

### Credit Hour Policy 
This syllabus reflects the federal definition of 1 credit hour, that is: 
> **1 credit hour** = **3 clock hours** of **engaged time** per week per 1 credit over a 15-week semester.  

This means that this course requires **9 clock hours of student academic work each week.**  

Student academic work (or engaged time) means **all your work in this class**: 
- Attend class meetings and participate in learning activities 
- Do weekly labs, readings, and assignments 
- Participate in collaborative learning experiences, such as working with peers on labs or the course team project 
- Participate in scheduled study groups 
- Seek and get tutoring help and other academic supports from the Library and CAE 
- Consult with and get assistance from the course instructor and classroom assistants 
- Attend one-on-one check-ins with class instructor to evaluate your progress. 

### Academic Integrity
**Individual products** of your learning in this class (design documents, code, reflections) or **individual contributions to collaborative work** (e.g., lab, team project) **must be entirely done by you**. You cannot submit as yours something done by others or obtained from external sources.

**Collaborative work** has clear requirements regarding the nature of collaboration. Grading is based on your **individual contribution to the collaborative work**. If unclear, you  must consult with course instructor on what is allowed. It is your  responsibility to get such clarification.

Whether done individually or in collaboration, **submitted coursework must ALWAYS give clear attribution to the source(s) of content** included or integrated in your work.
   - Annotate the content that originates or has been modified and integrated in your work.
   - Reference the source(s) you used, whether articles, forum or blog posts, public GitHub repos, tutorial videos, or individual help.
   - Give credit to individuals who have helped you, whether peers, tutors, lab/tech assistants, course instructor, or any other person (friend, relative, etc.)

**Do not work on behalf of someone else** and **do not provide your work products to others**. If you do, you commit an act of academic dishonesty. There is no way to know whether those who get your work products intend to submit them as their. Equally important, this is NOT how you help someone learn. 

There are very serious repercussions if you deviate from the course and univeristy academic integrity policy. The penalty for the **first occurrence** of academic misconduct is **no credit for the graded work** in question. The **second occurrence** of academic misconduct results in **failing the course**. You will receive notice of the academic misconduct allegation from the course instructor. The course instructor will meet with you and give you the opportunity to respond. If the violation stands, the course instructor will report it to the Office of Community Standards. 

Bottom line, **do not cheat, plagiarize, or faciliate academic dishonesty**. It is very important that you review the University's [Academic Integrity policy](https://catalog.unh.edu/srrr/university-policies-regulations/academic-integrity/).


### Canvas NameCoach 

We have a new tool in Canvas, NameCoach, that will help us all to pronounce each other’s names properly. Let’s make our learning environment as inclusive as possible by recording our names (instructions [here](https://td.usnh.edu/TDClient/60/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=4648)) and taking advantage of the opportunity to respectfully learn how to pronounce each other’s names.

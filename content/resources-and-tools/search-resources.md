Codecademy https://www.codecademy.com/about has a list of AI search algorithms.  

University of California Berkeley, CS 188 Intro to AI course had useful slides on search, https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/  

## Uninformed Search
- Depth-first search (DFS) 
- Breadth-first search (BFS) 
- Uniform-cost search 
- Iterative deepening search

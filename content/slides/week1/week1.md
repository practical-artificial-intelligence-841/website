## What is Artificial Intelligence?​
- As an academic discipline​
    - Study of computational systems that act  intelligently (a.k.a. computational agents)​
    - To act intelligently means​
        - Know what to do: Exhibit complex behavior to reach goals​
        - Know how to do it: ​
            - Sense, game play, reason, optimize, plan, process natural language, etc.​
        - Do it: Perform (or act) to meet those goals​
        - Learn: from past experience and prior knowledge​

## What is Artificial Intelligence?​
- As a technology ​
    - Software and tools platforms, services made by humans and used by humans​
- As a professional career​
    - Research scientist​
    - Software developer/engineer​
    - UX (user experience) designer​
    - Data scientist, data engineer​
    - More ...​

## Goals of AI​
- Scientific goal​
    - Understand how artificial and natural systems can act intelligently​
        - Analyze artificial and natural agents​
        - Formulate and test hypotheses about how to construct intelligent agents (AI)​
        - Design, build, experiment with computational systems that perform tasks that require intelligence​
- Engineering goal​
    - Design and make intelligent computational systems that are useful​
- Ethical goal

## Ethical Implications of AI and the Alignment Problem
**How to make AI align complex, autonomous systems with human norms and values?​**

AI systems as **objects** and their implications​
- Automation and unemployment​
- Privacy and manipulation​
- Human-robot interaction and autonomy​

AI systems as **subjects​**
- Machine ethics: ethics of AI systems themselves​
- Artificial moral agency​


## Ethical Implications of AI and the Alignment Problem
AI as **superintelligence​**
- singularity​

## Open and Closed Source AI
What makes an AI open or closed source?​
- Model weights are publicly available​
    - Model weights auditability versus classical programs​
    - What parameters were used to train the model?​
        - Can the results be replicated?​
- Dataset is publicly available
    - Is the dataset documented?​
        - Are limitations and biases explicitly defined?​
- AI-as-a-service​
    - ChatGPT, Bing AI, GitHub CoPilot​
        - CoPilot is trained on GitHub repos​
        - Would this be considered a publicly available dataset?​

## Human-Machine Teaming​
- AI as an assistant​
    - ChatGPT as a replacement for Google searches​
    - Article summarization​
- Human as the controller​
    - Human has final say as user – AI augments capabilities​
- Consequential versus non-consequential AI​
    - Shopping recommendations versus military use​
    - Human user has more control as potential consequences increase​
- Building trust in AI​
    - AI must output accurate, but also​
    - Reliable, safe, transparent, and explainable decisions​

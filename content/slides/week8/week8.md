## Neural AI: Reinforcement Learning
COMP 741/841 Week 8​

Fall 2024

## Agenda
- Lab 4 feedback
- Reinforcement Learning
- Getting started on Lab 6

## Lab 4 Feedback and Discussion
- Solution is entirely based on the Google OR CP-SAT implementation illustrated in the n-queens example​
- Incremental development is more than multiple commits​
  - Don't start incremental commits after completing the problem​
  - This is incremental commits, not incremental development​
- Docstrings should be descriptive​
  - "solves the problem with constraint programming" is not descriptive​

## CP-SAT Resources
